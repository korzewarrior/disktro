            <h2>Why use Disktro?</h2>
            <p>Disktro provides a centralized platform for you to find and download ISOs of various distributions. Instead of navigating through different distro homepages and hunting for the ISOs you want, Disktro saves you time and effort by gathering all the ISOs in one place. We ensure that all ISOs are sourced directly from the official websites of the respective operating systems, providing you with a secure and reliable source for your software needs.</p>

            <h2>Understanding 'x86', 'arm', 'net', and 'full'</h2>
            <p>'x86' and 'arm' refer to different types of processor architectures. 'x86' is a family of instruction set architectures initially developed by Intel but now used by a variety of manufacturers. It's commonly used in desktops and laptops. 'arm', on the other hand, is a type of processor architecture that's commonly used in mobile devices due to its power efficiency.</p>
            <p>'net' and 'full' refer to different types of ISOs. A 'net' ISO is a small image that only contains what's necessary to start the installation process. The rest of the files are downloaded during the installation process. This is a good option if you have a fast internet connection and want to save disk space. A 'full' ISO, on the other hand, contains all the files necessary for the installation process. This is a good option if you want to install the operating system on multiple machines or if you have a slow internet connection.</p>

            <h2>What is SHA256?</h2>
            <p>A SHA256 hash is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value. It's commonly used to verify the integrity of data. When you download a file, you can generate a SHA256 hash from the file. If the hash matches the one provided by the source, you can be sure that the file has not been tampered with. Learn more about SHA256 from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
            <h2>How to use SHA256?</h2>
            <p>After downloading a file, you can use a tool or a command in your operating system to generate a SHA256 hash from the file. Here's how you can do it on different operating systems:</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Linux:</strong> Use the 'sha256sum' command followed by the file name.
                <br>
                <strong>Windows:</strong> Use 'CertUtil -hashfile' followed by the file name and 'SHA256'. Learn more from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil" target="_blank">Microsoft Docs</a>.
                <br>
                <strong>macOS:</strong> Use 'shasum -a 256' followed by the file name.
            </p>
            <p>Compare the generated hash with the one provided by the source. If they match, the file is intact.</p>
            <h2>Why rely on SHA256?</h2>
            <p>Using SHA256 hashes is a way to ensure the integrity of the files you download. It helps you verify that the file has not been altered or tampered with since it was published. This is especially important when downloading software, as it helps protect against malicious alterations.
