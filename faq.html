                    <p>Disktro is a centralized resource hub for discovering and comparing Linux distributions. We provide direct links to official distribution mirrors, making it simpler for users to find the perfect Linux distribution for their needs without having to search across multiple websites. We don't host any ISO files ourselves; instead, we connect you directly to the official sources.</p>

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>While you can certainly go directly to each distribution's official website, Disktro offers several advantages:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Centralized Directory:</strong> We save you time by providing direct links to all major distributions in one place</li>
                        <li><strong>Comparison Tools:</strong> Our side-by-side comparison tool helps you evaluate distributions based on features, system requirements, and use cases</li>
                        <li><strong>Consistent Interface:</strong> Navigate different distributions with a unified experience, rather than learning different website layouts</li>
                        <li><strong>Curated Information:</strong> We provide standardized, easy-to-understand information about each distribution</li>
                        <li><strong>Simple Discovery:</strong> Our categorization and filtering help you find distributions that match your specific needs</li>

                    <p>We simply provide the information, comparison tools, and direct links to make your Linux discovery journey easier. The SHA256 checksums we display are also taken directly from the official sources so you can verify file integrity.</p>

                    <p>Linux is a free and open-source operating system kernel first released by Linus Torvalds in 1991. When people refer to "Linux," they often mean a complete operating system built around this kernel, which includes system utilities, applications, and a graphical user interface. These complete systems are known as Linux distributions or "distros."</p>

                    <p>Linux's open-source nature allows anyone to modify and redistribute it, leading to hundreds of distributions, each with specific goals:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>User Focus:</strong> Some target beginners (Ubuntu, Mint), others experienced users (Arch, Gentoo)</li>
                        <li><strong>Purpose-Built:</strong> Some are optimized for specific uses like security (Kali), privacy (Tails), or minimal resource usage (Puppy Linux)</li>
                        <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Some strictly adhere to free software principles (PureOS), while others include proprietary drivers and software for convenience</li>
                        <li><strong>Technology Choices:</strong> Distributions differ in package managers, release models, init systems, and desktop environments</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Live USB/DVD:</strong></p>
                    <p>Most Linux distributions can run directly from a USB drive or DVD in "live mode." This allows you to test the full operating system without installing anything on your hard drive.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>VirtualBox (free, works on Windows, macOS, Linux)</li>
                        <li>VMware Workstation Player (free for non-commercial use, Windows and Linux)</li>
                        <li>Parallels (paid, macOS)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Windows 10 and 11 users can install the Windows Subsystem for Linux, which provides a Linux environment directly within Windows. It's primarily command-line based, although graphical applications are possible.</p>

                    <p>Dual-booting allows you to have both Windows and Linux installed on the same computer, choosing which to use at startup. Here's a general overview of the process:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Backup your data</strong> - Always backup important files before modifying partitions</li>
                        <li><strong>Free up disk space</strong> - Shrink your Windows partition to create space for Linux</li>
                        <li><strong>Disable Fast Startup in Windows</strong> - This can cause issues with dual-boot setups</li>
                        <li><strong>Boot from Linux installation media</strong> - Use a USB drive with your chosen distribution</li>
                        <li><strong>Select "Install alongside Windows"</strong> - Most installers have this option</li>
                        <li><strong>Follow the installation wizard</strong> - The installer will guide you through the process</li>
                        <li><strong>Reboot</strong> - After installation, you'll see a boot menu allowing you to choose between Windows and Linux</li>
                    </ol>
